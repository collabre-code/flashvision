## Steps to create Flash Vision Status Web App

1. create the python script (main.py) with all necessary libraries
2. create docker file (Dockerfile) and containerize the script (resulting docker image (flashvisiondockerassignment) will contain the steps (layers) for downloading the necessary python libraries to run the script and an initiation command to run the code.
3. Add the containerized image to Azure container registry (flashcamregistry:latest)
4. Create a container instance in azure (flash-cam-status) using the containerized image as the image source.
5. Create a webapp (flash-cam-webapp2) in Azure with a php script (flash-cam-webapp.php) as the source file. The php script contains the html code for displaying the app contents and pulling the data from the SQL database (collabDataBase:FlashVisionStatus) generated by the python script (main.py) that runs in the container instance.




What I did
 1. Open VS Code
 2. Open folder containing docker file and python script
 3. build container image using docker build -t [name of image] .
 4. Open the docker extenstion in VS Code and located the image
 5. Right click the image and click push
 6. Selected the azure container registry to push to and push
 7. Went into the Azure portal and deployed a new container instance (once the container instance is deployed the python script should now run...If there is already a container instance running the same script, you should first stop that script).
 8. Deployed the php script for displaying the html page
